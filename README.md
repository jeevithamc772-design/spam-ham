# Spam Message Detection Web App

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that detects whether a given message is Spam or Ham (Not Spam).  
The model is trained using NLP techniques and deployed using Flask for real-time predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Machine Learning model for classification
- Flask-based web interface
- Real-time spam prediction
- REST API integration

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- HTML/CSS
- Git

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
3. Model training (e.g., Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)
4. Model evaluation
5. Model serialization using Pickle
6. Deployment using Flask
